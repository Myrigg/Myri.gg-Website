✨🎮 Welcome to **Myri.gg** - the semi-chaotic home of the Myri Gaming Community ✨  

---

## Why does this exist?  
- 🖥️ We already had the domain **myri.gg** for server hosting… so why not make a website too?  
- ⏳ I last touched web dev in the *90s*. Back then it was `<marquee>` tags, flaming GIFs, and auto-playing MIDI files. This is my nostalgia trip.  
- 🎨 I’m not a web developer. This isn’t professional. This is a side project to play with **Vibe Coding™** and see what sticks.  
- 🛠️ This site will not follow “best practices” (but hey, maybe I’ll refactor one day? …probably not, let’s be honest).  

---

## The Plan™  
- Throw HTML, CSS, and questionable JavaScript into a blender.  
- Sprinkle in some Vibe Coding AI magic.  
- Manually fix whatever vibe coding breaks.  
- End up with a website that is **“good enough.”**  
- Bonus: actually looks decent for the community.

## Disclaimer 🚨  
This repo may contain:  
- CSS duct tape 🩹  
- JavaScript hacks 🔧  
- Comments that are 50% documentation, 50% sarcasm 📝  
- An unhealthy amount of neon gradients 🌈  

**Pull requests welcome!**  
…but if you send me React boilerplate, I’ll replace it with `<blink>` tags out of spite. 😏
